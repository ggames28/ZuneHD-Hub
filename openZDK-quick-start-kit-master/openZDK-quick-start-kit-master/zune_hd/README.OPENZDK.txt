README

What is it
==========
OpenZDK provides the key headers and import libraries for the Zune HD and the
Windows Embedded CE 6.0 OS it runs on. If you are an end user, you do not need
to install OpenZDK itself - simply run the DeployKit installation packages in
this directory to install example programs put together using OpenZDK.

Additionally, a template is provided that includes the necessary exploit code
and a default project to build your applications on top of.

How do I use it
===============
Resources for OpenZDK development are provided on the Zune Dev Wiki at

Known issues
============
Installation will fail if the Documentation feature is selected and you do not
have Visual Studio 2005 installed. This feature is selected by default. To work
around this, select the Custom install type and set Documentation to "Entire
feature will be unavailable".
