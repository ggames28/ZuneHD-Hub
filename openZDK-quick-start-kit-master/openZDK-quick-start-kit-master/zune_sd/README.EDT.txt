Exploit Deployment Tool
Version 0.1 (2010-04-15)
README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is it
==========
The Exploit Deployment Tool unlocks the XNA runtime on your pre-HD Zune to make
it possible to install native applications that harness the full capabilities
of your Zune.

Do not use the Exploit Deployment Tool to hack the Zune HD; doing so is
unnecessary and will only serve to render all non-Microsoft applications
inoperable. If you find this out "the hard way", use the Unhack mode to perform
the reverse operation.

How do I use it
===============
